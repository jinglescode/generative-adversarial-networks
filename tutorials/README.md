### [Intuition Behind GANs](https://github.com/jinglescode/generative-adversarial-networks/tree/main/tutorials/01%20Intuition%20Behind%20GANs)

In this tutorial, we explore the basic structure of generative adversarial networks to gain some intuition about how it works.

### [Discriminator](https://github.com/jinglescode/generative-adversarial-networks/tree/main/tutorials/02%20Discriminator)

Now we know generative adversarial networks consist of 2 networks, generator and discriminator. In this tutorial, we will see how the discriminator works and its code.

### [Generator](https://github.com/jinglescode/generative-adversarial-networks/tree/main/tutorials/03%20Generator)

We have seen how the discriminator works, in this tutorial, we will look at how the generator works.
